## CSWT-Programmer-Case.scad

This was my first OpenSCAD project so it's probably not a wonderful resource.

## MarkerHolder-Bottom.scad

Bottom part of a white board marker holder.  It goes over a cubicle wall and holds two markers and an eraser.

## MarkerHolder-Top.scad

This is the top of the white board marker holder.  I used cyanoacrylate to glue them together.  Another approach might be to put some 1.8 mm holes in the the design and "rivet" them together with filament.

## UsbClip.scad

The holds a small, rectangular USB Hub to the back of a table so that the weight of the cables don't pull it out of place.

## cube-hook.scad

This is a modification of a file from www.myminifactory.com which goes over a cube wall and holds things.  My modifications improve the variable comments (IMHO) and clear up some microthin artifacts visible in OpenSCAD.
